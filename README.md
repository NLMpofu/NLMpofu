Howdy, I'm Naomi ðŸ˜Š

I'm an ex-Science teacher currently training to be a full stack developer with the School of Code; a fullstack coding bootcamp with a focus on collaborative working.

My love of the in's and out's of how things work has followed me from my 6 year teaching career into tech! I specialise in being able to take big brain concepts and break them down into bitesize, understandable chunks. Follow me over on [LINKED IN](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naomi-m-72025ba1/) as I document my journey with all its lumps and bumps.

I love all things story telling, so if you don't catch me learning code i'm most likely tango-ing with my latest obsession: Harry Potter Fan Fiction
